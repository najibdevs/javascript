# JavaScript Operators

## Assignment Operators
- `=`: Assigns value from right side operand to left side operand.
- `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`: Perform the operation (Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide, Modulus) on the variable and assign the result back to the variable.

## Arithmetic Operators
- `+`: Addition.
- `-`: Subtraction.
- `*`: Multiplication.
- `/`: Division.g
- `%`: Modulus (remainder).
- `++`: Increment operator; increases an integer value by one.
- `--`: Decrement operator; decreases an integer value by one.

## Comparison Operators
- `==`: Equal to.
- `===`: Strictly equal (value and type are the same).
- `!=`: Not equal.
- `!==`: Strictly not equal.
- `>`: Greater than.
- `<`: Less than.
- `>=`: Greater than or equal to.
- `<=`: Less than or equal to.

## Logical Operators
- `&&`: Logical AND; true if both operands are true.
- `||`: Logical OR; true if at least one of the operands is true.
- `!`: Logical NOT; inverts the truth value.

## Bitwise Operators
- `&`: AND.
- `|`: OR.
- `^`: XOR.
- `~`: NOT.
- `<<`: Left shift.
- `>>`: Right shift.
- `>>>`: Unsigned right shift.

## String Operators
- `+`: Concatenation; combines two string values to return another string.

## Conditional (Ternary) Operator
- `condition ? valueIfTrue : valueIfFalse`: Returns one of two values based on a condition.

## Type Operators
- `typeof`: Returns the type of a variable.
- `instanceof`: Returns true if an object is an instance of an object type.

## Void Operator
- `void`: Discards a return value of an expression.

## Comma Operator
- `,`: Allows multiple expressions to be evaluated in a single statement and returns the result of the last expression.

## Delete Operator
- `delete`: Used to delete a property from an object.

## Spread Operator
- `...`: Allows an iterable (e.g., array) to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments are expected.

## Optional Chaining Operator (?.)
- Allows you to safely access deeply nested properties of an object without having to check for the existence of each layer.
